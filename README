Template for a Django project

This sample template was built according to what I use more often in any kind of Django project.

It has my custom (unfinished) auth app (which uses email instead of username), also includes a configured django_toolbar (so I don't have to download and prepare it everytime) and the folders are organized the way I'm used to.

Feel free to use it.
